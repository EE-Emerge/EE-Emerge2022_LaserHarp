Status Updates:

Bela Board:

Harp Construction:

FFT:
  Audio Voltage from Bela
  Opamp (unity gain) to ADC to MSP430 to NeoPixel
  from out of MSP430 -> Dipswitch (buncha switches)
      ^ sets frequencies

  Map +-3V to 0-3.3V
  ADC resolution (0-3.3)

  Digital bandpass and whateve
  FFT hard to do on MSP430 (and slow) :') so we're doing this instead



Who wants to present on Friday?:
  > Jan's turn :O

Goals for next Tuesday:

Bela Board:
  Tutorials 3-4, make program with wavetable for testing sensors
  
Harp Construction:
  Choose materials, refine design to adhere to material constraints (extra credit: Add illumination to the instrument)
  
FFT:
  Create a PCB in KiCAD (reccomended) or Altium for the bandpass filters
  Create a basic CAD of the FFT Display in the Fusion 360 group
