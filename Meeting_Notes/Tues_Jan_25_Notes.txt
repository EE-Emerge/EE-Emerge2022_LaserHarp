Status Updates:
  Chantal has dropped the course: we need one more person on the FFT team
  We are now pursuing a Aether-Harp: the sensors are on the way?
  
Bela Board:
  > has 8 input pins
  
Harp Construction:
  How are we going to connect the Bela to the sensors? Do we need an intermediate mc?

FFT:
  Screen or LED strips?
      >   Aether harp loses the light effect of the lasers, LEDs make up for the missing light show
  > added Jan
     Band-pass filter method

Sean notes:
  Tell sean what we need and he'll get it (diodes + circuitry = ~$15)
  integrate or don't integrate speakers? 
        > determines enclosure build
        > what speakers do we want? over 5000 to choose from
        > ESDC opening up: are we going to use acrylic or plywood?
            > ESDC will start getting busy in like 2 weeks because other classes will need the space too
   Design PCB by mid-next week
        > 1 week for design/capture
        > 1 week for manufacturing
        > 0.5 week to assemble
    > PCB will make the wiring look good 
      > Bela board integrated to circuit
    > order extra ones to display/show on picnic day
   Find minimum design (enclosure, PCB) 
   
  TONIGHT
  > How many notes?
        7? 8? 12?
        12 is a good length
        going with

         > ordering two for intitial test
         >  sensor at 5V, bela operates at 3.3V // Voltage divider? Buck Converter/Step Down Converter?
   
      
 BY FRIDAY:
  > schematic for interface to Bela Board
  > integrate or don't integrate speakers?
      > Team leading towards external speakers
      > Bela inside harp
  
  
  > ~12 weeks countdown to picnic day
  
--------------------------------------------------  
---For Next Tuesday:
--------------------------------------------------
Bela Board:
  Do tutorial on analog/digital io (6-7) ASAP to see if bela can take input from sensors

Harp Construction:
  Rough CAD design in Fusion of the Aether Harp Base
  > More detail on CAD // Dimensions of Bela fit
  > Parameterize :))))
  Decide on Material
  
FFT:
  Design BPF
  > 20kHz and space 
  > Each BPF listens to audio input and certain amount of voltage readout
  2 op amps or 3, up to FFT team
