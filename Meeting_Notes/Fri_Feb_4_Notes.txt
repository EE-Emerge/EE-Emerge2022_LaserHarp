Objectives:
When will we be meeting each week?

PCB Deadline: 14th and 15th of February


Power supply!!!
--> Central :: 5V main supply (attached to PCB) (or use 12V and step down)
------> spilt into little 3.3V babies 



Do data processing within Bela Board
get twice amount of sensors


Block Diagram
> describe each system and how everything works together
MSP has an ADC


Distance Sensor -> 8 signals --> Analog FrontEnd--> 8 signals --> Bela --> Audio --> spilt audio --> Display and Speaker



Distance Sensor --> [unity gain buffer --> ADC Scaling... ---> U.G.B. & DRN] -->
                     ^======AFE (audio from end)==========^
   
 +-3.3~ V(Audio) -->   UGB (avoids backfeed) --> map to 0-3.3V with opAMP, scales --> MSP --> 
             
unity gain buffer
----Dist.Sens -------Vout
                 |
                 |
                 somthing here
                 |
                 GND
                 
  Test unity gain buff
    Test: 0 - 3.3V
    Test: 0 - 5.0V
    
    
Say we put in 5V...
    VVV 5V              VVV 5V                 0 - 3.3  ( Add opamp w/ 3.3 Vin)
[unity gain buffer --> ADC Scanning... ---> U.G.B. & DRN]


TI excel sheet that tells u what opamp/buffer and resistors to use :O


Just display Voltage to hand height on Neopixel

Another analyzer that looks at the overall sounds

> TWO DISPLAYS!!!??!?!
Bela releasess spectrograph on a screen (MATLAB), Freq vs. Time, every 30s or so, of the running update of what's played
MSP does Neopixel to show hand height // flashy 


A way to change instruments?


Working with MATLAB
> Download C code and upload on BELA


spilt audio --> Display and Speaker
> A/V spilter, 

Display
Acryllic Slots and put another acryllic sheet on top
Place Acryllic Strips
