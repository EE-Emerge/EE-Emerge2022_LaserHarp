Professor Notes
Average Energy of Band-Pass filter instead of FFT
> Band pass filter for each of our desired spectrums (ex. 200-400 Hz)
> the highest energy (strongest signal) is the freq we have
> Can light up LEDs accordingly

Bandwidths we want to have
> how precise do we want to be?
>> We answer this question
	> Would depend to how many laser diodes we have
	> If limited, we can do a specific scale (C major - 8 notes) and create the bandwidth to be the range of each note. (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C)

Potential Mentor in the Future
