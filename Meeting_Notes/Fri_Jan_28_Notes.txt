Prof. Notes
> Can we play multiple notes at a time?

Sean General Notes
> Access to upstaires EE-Emerge lab :: Each team have their own lockers
> Must wear N95 mask, must have an active fan in the room, Sean must be in the room as well

---Break-out Room --------

Construction Ideas
> Isaiah - Acryllic Enclosure with LEDs inside
or
> Thomas - LEDs on spray painted black board, Rectabgular enclosure
> Thomas - Big Fan Shape? Lol
> Arcyillic or wood?

Need seperate microcontroller to control LEDs (would be too much for Bela Board alone)
> Prof mentions some Cypress Microsystems board?

Bela Board : 
> Sensors run straight to Bela Board
> 8 Notes, need to sense all 8 at the same channel (multiple notes at the same time, as long as we program it that way)
    >  PIVOT: 7 sensors to that we can have more distance per sensors

BPF
Max Volts: 1V peak-to-peak
> Decide: 3 or 2 op-amps?
For FFT LEDS : 
> Spilt audio 
>> output from bela (audio, sine-whatever) sense the values and pass to analog output
>>> one channel to speakers, one to display

NEXT STEPS
Hook up distance sensors to Bela Board  
Meet at EE-E lab next Tuesday during normal Tues meeting time (make sure Sean's there)
    
 
BIG QUESTIONS---
> Distance Sensors : Cone shaped Field of View, How will this affect the notes played?
      > ANSWER: +-2 degrees, at max. height (80cm) each sensor should be spaces about 6cms to avoid cross-interference.
> How will we play multiple notes at the same time
    > Bela board can process multiple notes and add up signals
    > if hand hits middle of two sensors, both notes played
> How will we get rid of the Theremin sound? How will we implement BPF (analog filter or digital filter)
    > good filter with series of Filter bands and average Vs
    > or can digitalize it, a lot of flexibility, but processing time will go up
    > or microcontroller that can do the filtering and averaging (not TI :O )
          > Cypress Analog Contoller (?) 
       > https://www.design-reuse.com/news/6254/cypress-microsystems-analog-programmable-mixed-signal-arrays.html
          > can slide stuff?
          
          
  -----------------------------------
  Prof Warnings/Notes ---
 > IR sensors are VERY IFFY, previous teams have had trouble succesfully implementing them
 > Theremin sound is a NO, it sounds annoying :((
 > Will the BPF be analog or digital?
      
 > Take Digital signals processing course (EEC 151) 
  > EEC150 is req'd anyways and is pre-req for 151
