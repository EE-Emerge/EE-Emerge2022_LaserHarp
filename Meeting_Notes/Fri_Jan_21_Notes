----NOTES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be sure to pick out who's presenting next on Fridays!

FFT - Chanthal has taken EEC100, no preferance for the display yet

Mechanical - Leaning towards Aether and distance sensor // discrete boundaries, goes from note to note

Bela Board - Thomas and Nidhi at West village, Jan's at La Rue but can drive
> Built-in FFT algortihm and interacts with screen ie. mouse movement changes sound
> 3male pins, left speaker and right speaker
> ~20 IO pins
> Cool Sound: Shepard's Risset - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MShclPy4Kvc
> Tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCrgFeG6pwQmdbB6l3ehC8oBBZbatVoz3 
                ^is this the right playlist?


In-Person Meetings when school is back in-person?
> Need meeting space
>>> EE-Emerge Lab? Talk to Sean
>>> MU, SCC

Sean Notes
------------------
Distance Sensors : have either 9 or 16 sensors, 
> Proximity/Light sensor
Thomas: should we get new IR ones, like on the instructables? 4in-35in range

to use new sensors: need to put out a proposal and explain why we need it/why it's more benefical than laser
benefits: more levels/notes from a single sensor
          laser needs more percision and calibration
          safety!! lasers r dangerous :O 
            need saftey training on how to use lasers // n
          sketch of how it's gonna be implemented
          Smaller: flat 1-piece is more transportable than square
          > Submit early next week (maybe work on Tues during team meeting?) - email proposal to Prof and Sean
              > keep it simple: pro, cons, diagram(s)
              > how many would we need? Max. Num would be 13? chromatic scale + extra C to sandwich it
                > "for now let's say 6 inputs into the bela board" - Sean
          
          Need to find supplier
          > adafruit? https://www.adafruit.com/product/164
          > banana robotics - https://www.bananarobotics.com/shop/Sharp-GP2Y0A21YK0F-IR-Distance-Sensor
          > ebay - https://www.ebay.com/itm/311557016331?chn=ps&_trkparms=ispr%3D1&amdata=enc%3A17blqzN4GRjOgUtHOPonl_g44&norover=1&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-213727-13078-0&mkcid=2&itemid=311557016331&targetid=4580702891777576&device=c&mktype=&googleloc=&poi=&campaignid=418640321&mkgroupid=1233652283797640&rlsatarget=pla-4580702891777576&abcId=9300602&merchantid=51291

Note should be sent to  beagle bone which translates to actual sound
